I agree the in pubic restaurant is should be banned smoking .	45:59:00	"When the <object> of the <verb> <<ban>> is a person, the prohibited action is indicated by <from + gerund>. Therefore, if <<be banned>> is in the <active voice>, the <gerund> <<smoking>> should be preceded by the <preposition> `from'."
We should try to ban people smoking in public places .	21:35	"When the <object> of the <verb> <<ban>> is a person, the prohibited action is indicated by <from + gerund>."

Another reason that I do n't agree is the government does n't bane people smoking .	67:81	"When the <object> of the <verb> <<ban>> is a person, the prohibited action is indicated by <from + gerund>."
All restaurants have to ban people for smoking because the restaurants have many food and people are eating food in there .	35:38:00	"When the <object> of the <verb> <<ban>> is a person, the prohibited action is indicated by <from + gerund>."

I agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job .	8:12	"Since the <verb> <<agree>> is a <transitive verb> when it takes a <that-clause>, a <preposition> is unnecessary."
"According my idea , I agree about smoking should be completely at all the restaurant in the country because with that procedure to avoid air pollution and many sickness which caused by smoke ."	28:33:00	"Since the <verb> <<agree>> is a <transitive verb> when followed by a <that-clause>, a <preposition> is unnecessary. The <clause> needs to be in the form of a <that-clause> beginning with `that'."
Nobody agree with smoking is healthy .	13:17	"Since the <verb> <<agree>> is a <transitive verb> that can take <that-clause> as an <object>, the <object> does not require a <preposition>. As the <preposition> <<with>> is followed by a <clause> replace <<with>> with the <subordinate conjunction> 'that'."
Smoking affects bad for a smoking man .	20:23	"Since the <verb> <<affect>> is a <transitive verb>, the <object> does not require a <preposition>."
Many people abdicated to smoking and more people become abdicated .	22:24	"Since the <verb> <<abdicate>> is a <transitive verb>, the <object> does not require a <preposition>. Look up the use of the <verb> <<abdicate>> in the dictionary."
The government 's plan to ban smoking especially in the restaurant should not be agreed for several reasons .	81:91	"Since the <verb> << agree>> is an <intransitive verb>, a <preposition> needs to precede the <object>, and it also applies to sentences in the <passive voice>.

"These days , university students should choice a part time job because the students ca n't be supported their studying and living expenses by their parents ."	94:109	"Since the <transitive verb> <<support>> takes only one <object>, add a <preposition> that indicates a target or a topic preceding <<their studying and living expenses>>."
"First , it can provide college students a chance to get the working experience before they graduate from colleges ."	31:41:00	"Since the <transitive verb> <<provide>> takes only one <object>, a <preposition> is necessary before the second <object>. Look up the use of <verb> <<provide>> in the dictionary."
"To modern enterprises , diploma is not the only way to text the employee , working experience is become more and more important when a leader decides whether the employee to get the job or not ."	171:192	"Since the <subordinate conjunction> <<whether>> is followed by <<the employee>>, use it as the subject and the <verb> <<get>> of the <to-infinitive> <<to get>> as a <predicative verb> to form a <clause>."
There is an ongoing debate concerning around the issue as whether it is important for college students to have a part-time post .	55:57:00	"Since the <subordinate conjunction> <<whether>> can introduce a <noun clause> in <apposition> with the preceding <noun>, the <preposition> <<as>> is not necessary."
A graduate who only have high scores but no experience is not a real talent so that I just agree the topic about whether it 's important for college students to have a part time job .	107:112	"Since the <subordinate conjunction> <<whether>> can introduce a <noun clause> in <apposition> with the preceding <noun>, the <preposition> <<about>> is not necessary."
"I ca n't stay I 'm center of the world because guests choice restaurant which they want to go , so I need to make them comfortable for they choose my shop ."	91:95	"Since the <relative pronoun> <<which>> functions as a <noun>, a necessary element needs to be added when used with the <verb> <<go>>. A <preposition> is necessary to indicate the destination of <<go>>. Add the appropriate <preposition>."
Children born in these families are the very person who are cared for the whole families .	66:73	"Since the <relative clause> that follows <<who>> is in the <passive voice>, a <preposition> is necessary to indicate the <agent>."
Letting they know the disadvantage of its .	18:41	"Since the <pronoun> <<its>> is the <possessive> of the <pronoun> <<it>> and indicates the association, a <preposition> does not need to follow."
That 's why it is important for college students have a part-time job .	40:53:00	"Since the <pronoun> <<it>> is the <formal subject> of the <to infinitive> that follows, the <verb> <<have>> needs to be in the form of a <to infinitive>."
I agree that it is important for college students have a part-time job even though I have never worked at a part-time job .	41:54:00	"Since the <pronoun> <<it>> is the <formal subject> of the <to infinitive> that follows, the <verb> <<have>> needs to be in the form of a <to infinitive>."
I agree with in this sentence because smoking is bad for health .	13:15	"Since the <preposition> <<with>> is used to precede the target of agreement, the <preposition> <<in>> does not have any function in this <sentence>. Omit the <preposition> <<in>>."
"But , now many people smokes just to look cool , not to its function ."	53:55:00	"Since the <preposition> <<to>> is not used before a <noun> to express the purpose, use the <preposition> `for' here to express the purpose."
So I tried running away to smokers .	24:26:00	"Since the <preposition> <<to>> indicates a destination, it makes the expression mean ``toward smokers''. Use the <preposition> `from' instead to express ``to escape from smokers''."
But restaurants are opposite this statement .	20:28	"Since the <preposition> <<opposite>> is normally used to indicate a position or direction as in ``on the opposite side'' and ``in the opposite direction'', it should not be used to express ``to be against something''. The <adjective> `opposed' needs to be used with a <preposition> to express ``to be against something''. Look up the use of the <adjective> <<opposed>> in a dictionary."
"In Korea , we also ban smoking on many places but I think smokers do n't care about this rule ."	31:33:00	"Since the <preposition> <<on>> indicates that something is in contact with the surface of an object, it is not appropriate to use it with ''many places''. Use a dictionary to learn when to use the <prepositions> 'in', 'at', and <<on>> and use the appropriate <preposition>."
In Europe warnings of a cigarette case say to us that smoking leads to death .	19:21	"Since the <preposition> <<of>> can suggest that the words before and after <<of>> are in <apposition> as in ``warning about?€?'', it is more appropriate to use the expression ``on a cigarette case''. Think of another <preposition> that means ``on top of something''."
At least 20 kinds of cigarettes inside the Level A may contain carcinogens .	32:38:00	"Since the <preposition> <<inside>> is mainly used to refer to the internal side of an enclosed area or place, it is not the appropriate <preposition> to be used for indicating a part of a category. Use a <preposition> that expresses the relationship between a part and a whole."
Smoking in public restaurants is bad for people 's health so it should be signed that `` Please stop smoking for you and others '' in the wall of the restaurants .	131:133	"Since the <preposition> <<in>> means ``to be inside ...'', it should not be used with ``the wall''. Consult a dictionary to learn when to use the <prepositions> of place <<in>>, `on', and `at' and replace it with the appropriate <preposition>."
We can know what kind of environment and treat we will face when we work for a full-time job from working for a part-time job .	73:76	"Since the <preposition> <<for>> should be followed by the employer, <<for>> is not the appropriate <preposition> when the <verb> <<work>> is used as a <transitive verb> and the <noun> <<job>> as the <object>. It is more natural to use the <preposition> `in' or `at'."
I think that we should do many kinds of part-time job for 4 years in college .	54:57:00	"Since the <preposition> <<for>> indicates a continued period, using the preposition makes the sentence mean ''for a stretch of four years''. Think of another <preposition> of time."
"Because I also have to agree with all the money , therefore you try to work part-time over part-time students get something they want to work part-time can be about the number of part-time social work experience can not be taught in the schools , for example , services such as mental Family restaurant , a systematic correlation in the relationship between the school , you can learn things you can learn from ."	350:357	"Since the <preposition> <<between>> is normally used to indicate a connection ``involving two parties'', it should not be followed by <<the school>>. Look up the <noun> <<relationship>> in a dictionary and choose a <preposition> according to the context."
"So , because part-time job maybe Study could reduce the time to be sold on ."	5:22	"Since the <preposition> <<because>> is followed by a <noun> instead of a <clause>, add a <preposition> to use it as a <compound preposition>."
Matter because the house itself is a hard earned huge fees for students who attend because a little boon .	83:92	"Since the <preposition> <<because>> is followed by a <noun> instead of a <clause>, add a <preposition> to use it as a <compound preposition>."
"When I walk at road , many people smoking ."	12:14	"Since the <preposition> <<at>> is used to indicate a relatively small place, it is not appropriate to use it with the <verb> <<walk>> or the <noun> <<road>>. Look up the <prepositions> used with the <verb> <<walk>> in the dictionary and replace it with the appropriate <preposition>."
"The most important reason is if they get a job after graduate school , students who had a part-time job are better at social life than students who did n't have a part-time job ."	115:117	"Since the <preposition> <<at>> is normally used to indicate a point in time or place, it is not an appropriate <preposition> to be used with <<life>> in relation to ``social life''. Learn when to use the <prepositions> <<at>> and `in' and add the appropriate <preposition>."
"If the smoker have the conscious mind with every body at public zone , I think that 's not good to anybody but that 's so good to smoker too because the air in around here is not have a dangerous any body can breath with be joyous ."	157:159	"Since the <preposition> <<around>> is used later, this <preposition> is not necessary."
"Part-time job is a kind of social practice activity , which pays back material and soul rewarding , for brain and body 's work for special organization or person ."	65:69	"Since the <phrasal verb> <<pay back>> means ``to return/refund something?€?' or ``to avenge'', the <prepositional adverb> <<back>> is not necessary when expressing that ``work offers benefits''. Look up the use of the <verb> <<pay>> in a dictionary."

To make relationship with my students who I do n't know anything is also valuable .	56:67	"Since the <object> of the <transitive verb> <<know>> is <<anything>>, there is no room for the <antecedent> in the <relative clause>. <<Anything>> should be followed by a <preposition> to express ``to know nothing about my students''."

Look up the use of the <noun> <<effect>> in a dictionary."
Hopefully with a ban on smoking in public areas like restaurants can reduce the danger for young people to become active and passive smokers .	10:14	"Since the <noun phrase> following the <preposition> <<with>> is the <subject> of this sentence, the <preposition> <<with>> is not necessary."

As the <to-infinitive> should describe a past event, use the structure of <to + have + past participle>."
And I was rather tired within these days .	23:29	"Since <noun phrases> that indicate time function as <adverbial phrases> when used with <<this>>, 'these', or 'those' without a <preposition>, the <preposition> <<within>> is unnecessary."

Students need know what people want .	9:18	"Since <<need>> is used as an <auxiliary verb> in <negative> and <interrogative> sentences, it becomes a <principal verb> in <affirmative sentences>. Therefore, a <to infinitive> comes after the <verb> <<need>> instead of an <infinitive>."

They enjoy with that because smoking can decrease stress and sleepy .	11:15	"Because the <verb> <<enjoy>> is a <transitive verb>, the <preposition> <<with>> is unnecessary."
"Certainly , smoke of smoking do harm to your and other 's body , and heating cigarettes cause by fire and burn , and some people throw their cigarettes on the road , river and so on ."	94:96	"Because the <verb> <<cause>> is a <transitive verb> and it takes something to be generated as its <direct object>, a <preposition> is not needed."
"work would benefit to students the are : giving them money that they have earned , giving them satisfaction , fill some of their idle time ."	19:21	"Because the <verb> <<benefit>> can be used as a <transitive verb> to take ``a person who benefits'' as a <direct object>, the <preposition> is not necessary before the <<students>> who are the recipients of benefit."
So we non-smokers should bear to passive smoke .	30:32:00	"Because the <verb> <<bear>> is used in the sense of enduring something, it becomes a <transitive verb> that takes the ``object to endure'' as the <direct object>, so <preposition> <<to>> is unnecessary."
And to smoke in the public place such as a restaurant also influences for nonsmoker .	70:73	"Because <verb> <<influence>> is a <transitive verb> whose target object is a <direct object>, the <preposition> <<for>> is unnecessary."
It is important to experience for work .	30:33:00	"Because <verb> <<experience>> is a <transitive verb> and the target to be experienced is the <object>, the <preposition> <<for>> is unnecessary."
If we ban smoking it will increase visitor to the restaurant -LRB- as non smokers also will pay to visit -RRB- .	96:98	"Because <<visit>> is used together with the <verb> <<pay>> is a <noun>, it is not in the form of a <to-infinitive>, but the <object> of the <verb> <<pay>>. Leave it as it is."
"But in certain place , such as malls , restaurants , hospitals , and school forbid people to smoking ."	4:06	"Based on the structure of the sentence, as a series of <nouns> that follow the <preposition> <<in>> become the <subject> of the <verb> <<forbid>>, the <preposition> <<in>> is unnecessary."
"So , secondhand smoking is very bad to health ."	36:38:00	'Bad' takes a different <preposition> instead of <<to>> to qualify the subsequent element. Use a dictionary to learn the <prepositions> used with the <adjective> <<bad>>.
Still I have work a part time job in a weekend .	8:17	"Aside from exceptions such as `go' and `come', <verbs> in their <base form>can not be used successively. Add `to' to indicate ``will have to ~''."
And a part-time job is a good chance which we have a communication .	30:42:00	"As what is described in the <relative clause> occurs in the <antecedent> <<chance>>, when the <relative pronoun> <<which>> is used instead of the <relative adverb> 'where', a <preposition> needs to precede <<which>>. 'At' is the <preposition> to be used with <<chance>>. Add it in the appropriate place."
so that the owners of the restaurant was set up rules with wisdom that is by separating the place between people who smoke by not smoking .	74:76	"As what follows <<separating>> refers to the <antecedent> <<rules>>, the structure of the relative clause is <A = B> which does not require the <preposition> <<by>>."
"You will gain a very important experience , working with people , which you will not be able to gain in a college\/university ."	101:103	"As using the <preposition> <<in>> tends to emphasize the state of being ``inside the university building'', it is more appropriate to use the <preposition> `at' to refer to a university as an educational institution."

"In the words , I do n't think college students have a part-time job is important ."	38:51:00	"As the portion from <<college>> to <<job>> is the <subject> in the <subordinate clause>, this part needs to be <nominalized>. Express the <verb phrase> with <to infinitive>."
"Last year ago , New York declared a severe order about stop smoking in the world , people are banned smoke in public places , which include bars , restaurants , offices , auditorium , and so on ."	94:106	"As the expression ``someone is banned from doing something'' is formed using the structure  <ban + someone + from + gerund> in the <passive voice> in which ``someone'' is used as the <subject>, change the form of the <verb> <<smoke>> accordingly."
